Overload is a Scilab toolbox to overload Scilab's macros.

To install it :
	
	- Just launch Scilab and type `exec builder.sce'
	- You can see a demo in typing `exec demos/overload.dem' 

I wrote this toolbox under Debian Lenny with a kernel 2.6.26 and Scilab 5.1.1.

For the windows port: a big thanks to Allan Cornet and Yann Collette
